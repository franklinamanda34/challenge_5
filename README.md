Challenge 5




Using divs for each work hour, i was able to create a time block for all work hours 9-5 including the save buttons.

I was able to get the current date and time to display using js id within the html document. I used this source for assistance

 I was able to get the colors to transition accordingly within the HTML file by adding a class for past, present and future
